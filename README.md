# Icons
Offers icons for guis in a way that a missing icon file 
is detected at compile time rather than in runtime. 

Since this shall be open source, we restrict ourselves to the gif format. 
Besides the gif pictures, 
categorized by their location in a folder structure, 
there is a parallel structure of java classes in their packages. 
All these java classes extend the class 
eu.simuline.util.images.GifResource. 

In the long run, this project provides only those icons 
which are likely to be needed in any gui, 
like those in the menues file, edit, help and so on. 

For an example of usage see http://www.simuline.eu/TestHelpers/. 
TBD: this shall be made public.
