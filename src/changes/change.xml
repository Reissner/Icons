    <!-- TBD: in folder main/resources/ there is a tar icons.tar 
	 which shall be re-placed.  -->
    <!-- TBD: in folder main/resources/eu/simuline/sun/plaf/ocean 
	 there are java-sources where gifs shall be placed. -->
    <!-- TBD: There are classes which are not in subpackages of eu.simuline, 
	 which is not allowed. 
	 Better would be if they were in eu.simuline.images. -->
    <!-- TBD: Rework on pom.xml inspired by other poms.  -->
    <!-- TBD: java classes and gifs dont fit: 
	 - eu.simuline.sun.motif 
	 - eu.simuline.sun.windows: warn could be added -->
    <!-- TBD: README.md: provide a public example of usage. -->
    <!-- TBD: Take https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/png-gif into account. 
	 in fact, we have both, gif and png, 
	 the latter of which is currently not usable. 
	 Maybe both shall be usable, which would need a parameter 
	 or a subclassing IconResource base 
	 of both GifResource and PngResource. -->
